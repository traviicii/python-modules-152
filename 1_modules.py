# Python Modules

# Modules in Python : Modules in Python are either built-in toolboxes, or toolboxes that we build ourselves and import into projects that need them

# Modules typically contain functions, variables, and classes

import helper # Importing the entire module and of its contents

helper.d()

from helper import d # Importing only the specific tools I need from the specified module

# Why??

#-- Efficiency : Why build something, or repeatedly build something when it's already done or already exists
#-- Organized : Keeping our code tidy by separating our concerns into their own designated spots
#-- Reusability : Recycle and reuse the tools we create or import
